  <h1>About Me - Zahra Nada Hassan</h1>
<h2>Hello there!</h2>  
  <p>I'm Zahra Nada Hassan, but you can call me Zahra. Welcome to my portfolio, where I'm on an exciting journey to explore the world of coding and web development. I may not have extensive work experience, but my passion for learning and creating has led me down this path, and I can't wait to share my progress with you.</p>
  <p>Since I was a student, I've been fascinated by languages, and the art of coding feels like learning a language all over again. I've dabbled in Arabic, Turkish, Korean, Japanese, Thai - connecting with people from various backgrounds and cultures brought me immense joy. Witnessing the comfort, smiles, and joy on their faces as they overcame language barriers inspired me to explore new ways of connecting with others.</p>
  <p>Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development, learning HTML and CSS, and it's been an exhilarating experience so far. I'm following the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu, the brilliant mind behind the app brewery, through her Udemy boot camp course. With determination and an adaptive personality, I believe I can make a meaningful impact in this field.</p>
  <p>Outside the world of coding, my caring and empathetic nature led me to study health and social care, where I initially thought I'd become an adult nurse. However, my newfound passion for web development has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me.</p>
  <p>In the face of challenges and problem-solving, I persevere. I firmly believe that with dedication and strong willpower, anything is achievable. Though I may not have received notable recognition, awards, or achievements yet, my drive to excel in computer programming pushes me forward.</p>
  <p>Beyond coding and my professional pursuits, I find balance and joy in various hobbies and interests. Korean music, movies, dramas, and TV shows add a touch of excitement to my life. Japanese anime sparks my imagination and creativity. When I'm not coding or immersed in entertainment, I enjoy relaxing holidays, funfairs, and the beach. Staying active is vital for me, and you can often find me at the gym, playing badminton, or spiking a volleyball.</p>
  <p>My personal philosophy revolves around perseverance. No matter how challenging something might seem, I firmly believe that persistence is the key to success. I'm thrilled to apply this principle to my web development journey and showcase my progress through this portfolio.</p>
  <p>Thank you for stopping by and joining me on this adventure. Feel free to explore my projects and follow along as I continue to grow and evolve in the world of coding.</p>
